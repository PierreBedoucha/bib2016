# bib2016
This repository contains all the necessary files for the BIB 2016 meeting mental activities.

The exercises are taken from Rosaling website - http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ - 
You can complete any exercise from any soup at any time. 
There will be some substantial bonus for the teams which manage to get all the exercises of a given soup.

Exercise soups

The 'soups' - pool of exercises - have been designed so that the exercises follow a progression path. 
In most cases, you'll be guided to re use a solution from a previously accomplished exercise.

Grading 

The grading is organised as follows:
- The first 3 exercies are 2 points each
- The next exercises up until the last 2 exercies are 6 points each
- The last 2 exercises are 25 points each
- Bonus: Completing a soup in it's entirety rewards 50 points

The team which has the higher score wins
